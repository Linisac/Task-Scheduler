//The algorithm is based on the tree representation of set given in Section 21.3 Disjoint-set forests
//in textbook, where the 2 heuristics 'union by rank' and 'path compression' are used. Whenever a
//deadline of a task is given, we look for the representative of the set in which that deadline is a
//member, and reference its available_slot (detailed in next paragraph) to assign it to the task; the
//entire set is then merged (linked) to the set that precedes it in time. (If the above available_slot
//is the first time slot, then we merge the entire set with the LAST set in time.)

//The type slot_set is used for sets of slots. We have an additional attribute 'available_slot'
//to point to the (real) available time slot of a set of slots, since the representative of the set
//(i.e. the root of the tree) may not itself be the available slot. In this implementation, time slots
//are put in an array and hence are referenced by index instead of pointer.

//The procedures based on those in textbook. Note that we use an array and indices to refer to a time
//slot, so an additional parameter, i.e. the slot_set[] array, is given as part of the input.
//Also, instead of pointers, we use array indices in the procedures.
//Since the function link is part of C standard library, we rename the procedure link in textbook to
//merge here.

//To be compatible with textbook, we let time slots and tasks start from 1. In other words, time 1
//is the time interval [0, 1]. However, in our internal representation we let both start from 0
//due to C's array indexing. That said, the messages printed out on screen is not affected, though.
//On the other hand, this implementation allows the user to enter the number of tasks and randomly
//generates the deadlines; in case the user does not enter a valid number, the default tasks are
//used. The tasks are assumed to have been sorted into monotonically decreasing order by penalty.
//Hence, only the deadlines of tasks are relevant, and penalties are not implemented in this program.
